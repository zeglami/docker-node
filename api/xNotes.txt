Run/Stop the Project
-----------------------------------------------------------

Cleaning:
- **docker system prune:** Use this command to remove unused Docker resources, such as stopped containers,
 dangling images, and more. It helps you reclaim valuable disk space. Make sure Docker Desktop is running before
  executing this command.

--------------
Running the Project:
- **docker-compose up:** Launch your project defined in the docker-compose.yml file. This command starts
 the specified services, creating containers and connecting them according to the defined configurations.
  It's the first step in getting your application up and running.
--------------
Stopping the Project:
- **docker-compose down:** This command gracefully stops and removes the containers, networks, 
and volumes defined in your docker-compose.yml file. It ensures that resources are cleaned up without leaving behind artifacts.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Management
-------------------------------------------------------------

Stopping and Cleaning Up All Resources:
- **docker-compose down --rmi all -v:** When you need to completely reset your project,
 this command not only stops and removes containers, networks, and volumes but also removes all associated images. 
 It provides a clean slate for rebuilding and testing your project from scratch.
